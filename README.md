# Handwritten-Geometric-Shape-Detector
# Description : 
I created a python desktop application. This application allows the user to draw any geometric shape. Then the python script takes the shape and feeds the picture into a machine learning model. I used CNN model. The model is trained under 2000 images of handwritten circle, square, rectangle, triangle. The model predicts the shape of the drawn image and tells the user the shape and how confident the model is about the detection through a prediction score. 

# Main files : 
1. The python script : app3.py 
2. The model : shapedetector_model_4b.h5

# Instructions to run the application : 
1. Keep the model file 'shapedetector_model_4b.h5' in the same directory where the "app3.py" is.
2. Type 'python3 app3.py' to run the application.

There are tons of files in this project. Don't get overwhelmed. I didn't have time to clean those. Also I was trying to make the model better. For detecting the 4 shapes all you need is app3.py file and 'shapedetector_model_4b.h5' file. These 2 files are the most stable ones. Keep these in one directory and run python3 app3.py. 

# Requirements : 
You might need some modules installed in your pc. After running app3.py if the console asks you to download those just install those.
